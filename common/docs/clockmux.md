# Clock Multiplexer (clockmux) Module Documentation

## 1. Overview and Module Description

The `clockmux` module is a parameterized clock multiplexer designed to select one clock signal from multiple input clocks based on an enable vector. It allows for dynamic clock selection in digital designs where multiple clock domains are present.

## 3. Table of Ports

| Port Name | Direction | Width | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| en        | Input     | N     | One-hot enable vector. Only one bit should be active at a time. |
| clkin     | Input     | N     | One-hot clock inputs. Only one clock should be active at a time. |
| clkout    | Output    | 1     | Selected output clock signal. |

## 4. Table of Parameters

| Parameter Name | Default Value | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| N              | 1             | Number of clock inputs. Determines the width of `en` and `clkin` ports. |

## 5. Important Implementation Details

- The module uses a generate block to create a scalable design based on the `N` parameter.
- Clock selection is implemented using a bitwise AND operation between `clkin` and `en`, followed by a reduction OR operation.
- The enable vector (`en`) must be stable to avoid glitches in the output clock.
- Only one bit in the `en` vector should be active (1) at any given time to ensure proper operation.
- Similarly, only one clock in the `clkin` vector should be active at any given time.

## 7. Major Bugs or Caveats

1. Glitch Sensitivity: The output may glitch if the enable vector (`en`) changes while clocks are active. Ensure that `en` changes only when it's safe to do so.
2. Multiple Active Clocks: If multiple clocks in `clkin` are active simultaneously, the output behavior may be undefined or lead to clock glitches.
3. No Clock Gating: This module does not implement true clock gating. Inactive clocks are still toggling, which may lead to unnecessary power consumption in large designs.
4. Timing Considerations: Designers must carefully consider setup and hold times when using this module in a larger system, especially when switching between clocks of different frequencies or phases.
5. Synchronization Issues: The module does not handle clock domain crossing. Additional synchronization may be required when using the output clock in a different clock domain.
