# Delay Module Documentation

## 1. Overview and Module Description

The `delay` module is a simple, parameterized Verilog module designed to introduce a configurable delay to an input signal. It takes an input of arbitrary width and produces an output of the same width after a specified delay. This module can be useful in various digital design scenarios where signal timing adjustments are necessary.

| Parameter Name | Default Value | Description                                |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| DW             | 1             | Width of input and output data             |
| DELAY          | 0             | Delay value (in simulation time units)     |

## 5. Important Implementation Details

- The module uses a generate block to create the delay.
- The delay is implemented using a `#DELAY` statement before the assignment.
- The entire input bus is assigned to the output bus after the specified delay.
- The width of the input and output is parameterized, allowing for flexible use with different data widths.
- If DELAY is set to 0, the module will effectively act as a wire, passing the input directly to the output without any delay.

## 7. List of Major Bugs or Caveats

- The DELAY parameter is only effective in simulation and does not translate to actual hardware delay in synthesis.
- Care should be taken when using large DELAY values, as this can significantly impact simulation time.
- The module does not include any clock input, making it unsuitable for use in synchronous designs without modification.
- In real hardware implementations, precise delays are difficult to achieve and may vary due to factors such as temperature, voltage, and manufacturing variations.
