# CRC32 64-bit Module

## 1. Overview and Module Description

This Verilog module implements a 64-bit CRC32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check) calculation. It takes a 64-bit input data and a 32-bit CRC state, and produces the next 32-bit CRC state. The CRC32 algorithm is commonly used for error detection in digital networks and storage devices.

This module does not have any parameters.

## 5. Important Implementation Details

- The module implements a combinational logic for CRC32 calculation.
- It uses the standard CRC32 polynomial: x^32 + x^26 + x^23 + x^22 + x^16 + x^12 + x^11 + x^10 + x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1.
- The calculation is performed in parallel for all 32 bits of the CRC.
- Each bit of the output (crc_next) is calculated using XOR operations on selected bits from the input data and current CRC state.
- The implementation is optimized for 64-bit input data, allowing for faster CRC calculation compared to byte-by-byte methods.

## 7. List of Major Bugs or Caveats

No known bugs or caveats exist for this module. However, users should note:

- The module assumes little-endian bit ordering.
- For proper CRC calculation across multiple data chunks, the crc_state input should be initialized to 0xFFFFFFFF for the first chunk, and then fed with the previous crc_next for subsequent chunks.
- The final CRC value should be XORed with 0xFFFFFFFF to obtain the standard CRC32 checksum.
