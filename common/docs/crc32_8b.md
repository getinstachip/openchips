# CRC32 8-bit Module Documentation

## 1. Overview and Module Description

The `crc32_8b` module implements a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) algorithm for 8-bit data inputs. It calculates the next CRC state based on the current input data and the previous CRC state. This module is commonly used for error detection in data communication and storage systems.

The CRC-32 polynomial used in this implementation is: x^32 + x^26 + x^23 + x^22 + x^16 + x^12 + x^11 + x^10 + x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1.

## 4. Table of Parameters

This module does not have any parameters.

## 5. Important Implementation Details

- The module implements a combinational logic circuit to calculate the next CRC state.
- Each bit of the `crc_next` output is calculated using XOR operations on specific bits from `data_in` and `crc_state`.
- The implementation follows the CRC-32 polynomial, ensuring proper error detection capabilities.
- The module processes 8 bits of input data in parallel, making it suitable for byte-oriented data streams.
- The calculation is performed in a single clock cycle, allowing for high-speed CRC computation.

## 7. List of Major Bugs or Caveats

- No known bugs or caveats exist for this module.
- It's important to note that this module calculates a single step of the CRC process. For a complete CRC calculation over a data stream, this module should be used iteratively, feeding the `crc_next` output back into the `crc_state` input for each new byte of data.
- The initial value of `crc_state` and any final XOR operations required by the CRC-32 standard are not handled within this module and must be managed externally.
