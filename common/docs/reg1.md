# reg1 Module Documentation

## 1. Overview and Module Description

The `reg1` module is a parameterized register with asynchronous reset functionality. It is designed to store and output data of a configurable width. The module latches input data on the falling edge of the clock and presents stable output data when the clock is high.

## 5. Important Implementation Details

- The module uses a generate block to create a parameterized register.
- Data is latched on the positive edge of the clock.
- The register is reset to all zeros when the asynchronous reset signal (nreset) is low.
- The output is continuously assigned from the internal register, ensuring that it remains stable when the clock is high.

## 7. List of Major Bugs or Caveats

- The module description states that data is latched when clk=0, but the implementation actually latches data on the positive edge of the clock. This discrepancy between the comment and the actual behavior could lead to confusion or incorrect usage.
- Care should be taken when using this module in designs with different clock domains, as it does not include any clock domain crossing mechanisms.
