# Clock OR Module (clockor)

## 1. Overview and Module Description

The `clockor` module is a parameterized Verilog module designed to perform a logical OR operation on multiple clock inputs. It takes N clock inputs and produces a single clock output. The module is intended for use in scenarios where multiple clock sources need to be combined into a single clock signal.

## 5. Important Implementation Details

- The module uses a generate block to create a scalable design based on the `N` parameter.
- The clock output (`clkout`) is produced by performing a bitwise OR operation on all input clocks.
- The module assumes that the input clocks are one-hot encoded, meaning only one clock input should be active at any given time.
- The implementation uses continuous assignment (`assign`) for combinational logic, which means the output will change immediately in response to input changes.

## 7. List of Major Bugs or Caveats

1. The module assumes one-hot encoding for input clocks. If multiple input clocks are active simultaneously, the output may not behave as expected.
2. There is no built-in mechanism to detect or handle violations of the one-hot input assumption.
3. The module does not include any clock domain crossing (CDC) logic, which may be necessary when combining clocks from different domains.
4. Care should be taken when using this module in designs with strict timing requirements, as the OR operation may introduce small delays or glitches in the output clock signal.
