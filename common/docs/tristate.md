# Tristate Buffer Module

## 1. Overview and Module Description

The `tristate` module is a parameterized bidirectional buffer implementation in Verilog. It allows for the creation of a configurable width tristate buffer, which can be used to control the direction of data flow on a bidirectional bus. The module supports individual output enable control for each bit of the bus.

| Port Name | Direction | Width | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| io        | inout     | N     | Bidirectional port |
| oe        | input     | N     | Output enable (1 = output, 0 = input) |
| in        | output    | N     | Port as input |
| out       | input     | N     | Port as output |

| Parameter Name | Default Value | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| N              | 1             | Width of the ports |

## 5. Important Implementation Details

1. The module uses a generate block to create N instances of tristate buffers, where N is the parameterized width.
2. Each bit of the `io` port can be individually controlled as an input or output using the corresponding bit in the `oe` (output enable) port.
3. When `oe[i]` is 1, `io[i]` is driven by `out[i]`.
4. When `oe[i]` is 0, `io[i]` is in high-impedance state (Z), effectively making it an input.
5. The `in` port always reflects the current state of the `io` port, regardless of the `oe` value.

## 7. Major Bugs or Caveats

There are no known major bugs in this implementation. However, users should be aware of the following caveats:

1. Care should be taken when multiple instances of this module are connected to the same bidirectional bus to avoid bus contention.
2. The module does not include any pull-up or pull-down resistors. If required, they should be implemented externally.
3. Timing considerations for tristate buffers should be taken into account in the overall system design, especially for high-speed applications.
